AGE of Joy is an experience for VR (Meta Quest 2) where you can relive those happy days when you spent some coins at the game gallery. It’s not really a game but you can play games on it.

Do you remember when you used to go to the game gallery to play? We know that those days are gone, and new generations are not really interested in this kind of experience, in a world where games have evolved into something different and the game industry takes a different path, those galleries are, logically, disappearing. This experience is an attempt to preserve the galleries, that feeling, in a virtual world where anyone with a VR headset can experiment with it.
